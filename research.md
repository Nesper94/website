# Research

I have broad research interests ranging from molecular biology and botany
to computer science and mathematics.

## Currently

I am currently engaged in research projects related to systems biology,
soil microbiome and bioinformatics.

## As master student

My master thesis consisted mainly in studying network motifs in gene
regulatory networks able to produce cell differentiation.

## As undergraduate student

During my time as undergraduate student I worked in "wet lab" research
related to infectious diseases in the **Biolog√≠a y Control de Enfermedades
Infecciosas (BCEI)** lab. I worked mainly with vector competence of the
mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ and its interactions with Dengue Virus and
Chikungunya Virus. I worked a lot with cell cultures and plaque assays.
