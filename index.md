# About me

I am a graduate student currently working in the [Grupo de Fundamentos y
Enseñanza de la Física y los Sistemas Dinámicos](https://fenfisdi.home.blog/)

to obtain my Master degree in Biology with emphasis on Systems Biology.
I also work as assistant professor of the course of Genetics in the
Institute of Biology at the UdeA.
